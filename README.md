# Craft Extension Typescript-React Template with TailwindCSS

This is a version of the Typescript-React Craft Extension Template that includes [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) support.

It uses the [TailwindCLI installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) format, which outputs a static CSS file for use by the application.

## Testing

To get started, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to launch the TailwindCLI watcher and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dev server. Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to see live updates as you edit `app.tsx`.

Run `npm run build` to generate the .craftX file which can be installed.
